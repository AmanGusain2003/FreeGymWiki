Thank you for your interest in contributing to FreeGymWiki! Below are the steps to guide you through the contribution process.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

To begin contributing, fork the FreeGymWiki repository by clicking on the 'Fork' button at the top right corner of the repository page. This action will create a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Make Changes

After forking the repository, make the necessary changes or additions to your local copy. You can make edits directly on the GitHub interface or clone the repository to your local machine for more significant contributions. Ensure that your changes align with the project's guidelines and standards.

## Step 3: Create a Pull Request

Once you've made your changes and are ready to propose them for review and inclusion in the main project, submit a Pull Request. In the Pull Request, provide a clear and descriptive title along with a detailed explanation of the changes you've made. This helps maintainers and contributors understand the purpose of your contribution.

## Step 4: Work in a Local Environment

For substantial modifications, it's recommended to work in a local development environment. By cloning the repository to your machine, you can make changes using your preferred code editor or development tools. This approach allows for better testing and development before submitting a Pull Request.
