# FreeGym: Community-Driven Peer-Review

Collaborative wiki for evidence-based fact checks of claims made in fitness videos, articles, and media. Goal is to promote reliable fitness information and constructive dialogue through transparent sourcing, clear explanations, and input from professionals and enthusiasts. Each fitness claim gets a page with a verifiable fact-check rating. Please review the contribution guidelines and code of conduct.

  <summary><h2> Why?</h2></summary>

Misinformation and unsubstantiated claims are rampant in online fitness content. This wiki aims to counter that by promoting science-backed information through collaborative fact-checking.

1. **Personal Opinion Over Science:** A significant number of fitness influencers and content creators prioritize personal anecdotes and opinions over scientific evidence, claiming their statements are scientific. While personal experiences and professional practices can provide valuable insights, they should not replace or overshadow scientifically validated information. There's a need to distinguish between what's anecdotal and what's evidence-based.

2. **Lack of Context:** Many fitness claims are presented without proper context. For instance, a workout that might be effective for someone who's been training for years might not be suitable for a beginner. Or a diet that works wonders for one person might be detrimental to another. It's vital to understand the bigger picture. Moreover, some influencers portray their recommendations with such authority that viewers might wrongly assume those suggestions apply universally. In reality, what's relevant for one athlete or individual might not be for others. Understanding the nuances and individualized nature of fitness is crucial to prevent misinformation.

3. **Algorithmic Superficiality:** Platforms like Instagram prioritize content that garners quick engagement. Consequently, influencers often produce superficial or sensationalized content, which, while eye-catching, lacks depth, accuracy, or sincerity. Such content can often lead to more confusion than enlightenment.

4. **The “Expose” Culture:** The recent trend of "exposing" other influencers for their beliefs or practices has shifted focus from genuine knowledge-sharing to creating controversies. While healthy debates and discussions are fundamental, leveraging them merely for views and engagement detracts from the genuine pursuit of knowledge and can confuse and misguide audiences.

5. **Erosion of Constructive Dialogue:** The rapid rise of online interactions has unfortunately given way to an environment where negativity and toxicity often overshadow constructive dialogue. Personal attacks, unconstructive criticism, and heated arguments without basis have become common, drowning out voices that aim to promote positivity, understanding, and genuine learning. This environment not only hampers the free flow of reliable information but also discourages newcomers and experienced individuals alike from engaging in fruitful discussions.

6. **Maximizing the Good:** Gaining attention might benefit an influencer's growth, but it's not always in the best interest of the broader community. The primary aim should be to maximize the good, promote accurate information, and build a culture of learning and mutual respect.

This community provides a neutral platform for enthusiasts, professionals, and creators to dig deeper into fitness claims away from hype and algorithms. The fact-checking process focuses on transparent sourcing, weighing the merits of evidence, and providing context around truths. Together we can build fitness literacy and further collective knowledge.

  <summary><h2> What’s Our Short-Term Goal?</h2></summary>

Our immediate focus is to identify the founding fathers and mothers of modern fitness and build the initial founding community for collaborative fact-checking and jointly drafting our constitution. 

This fitness fact-checking constitution will outline our core principles, shared values, standards, policies, and processes.

Ideally, this diverse founding group would consist of:

- Fitness professionals able to evaluate claims and contribute expertise
- Enthusiasts willing to research evidence and provide analysis
- Content creators interested in improving the ecosystem
- Any others passionate about furthering fitness literacy

This engaged founding community will collaborate on structuring how we:

- Select claims for evaluation
- Conduct systematic and unbiased fact-checking
- Conflict resolution
- Leadership and governance
- Rewarding participation
- Maintain civil and constructive dialogue
- Upholding ethics and conduct

The diverse founding members will collaborate on writing this constitution to align with our mission, principles, and intentions as a community. The Constitution will provide the groundwork for how we operate with transparency, rigor, inclusiveness, and constructive impact.

If this mission resonates with you, reach out to join the founding member discussion. Let's maximize the good.

  <summary><h2>My Limitations</h2></summary>
  
As the initiator of this fitness fact-checking community, I recognize my own limitations. I am just one person with a constrained perspective and finite knowledge.

I do not claim to have all the answers or be an infallible authority. I am bound to make mistakes or oversights at times. My brain bandwidth is restricted, my memory is imperfect, and my expertise has boundaries.

That is precisely why building this as a diverse, collaborative community is so important. No single individual can evaluate the endless complexity of fitness information alone. This wiki needs the collective insights of professionals, enthusiasts, creators, and science communicators from all backgrounds.

My role is merely to prompt the initial spark and framework for community-driven fact-checking. I cannot and will not dictate the principles, policies, or processes alone. That will be a democratic and iterative effort, defined publicly through suggestions and civil discourse.

The goal is to tap into our collective wisdom through respectful debates, transparency, weighing evidence, and upholding ethical standards. Only together can we truly maximize reliable fitness knowledge, lift each other up, and further the greater good.

My voice is limited, but our voices combined have power. I look forward to learning from you all as we shape the future of fitness education together.

I will not write it alone. That would inject bias. This is where the founding community comes in.

रिश्ता दिल से दिल के ऐतबार का <br>
ज़िन्दा है हमीं से नाम प्यार का <br>
के मर के भी किसी को याद आयेंगे <br>
किसी के आँसुओं में मुस्कुरायेंगे <br>
कहेगा फूल हर कली से बार बार <br>
जीना इसी का नाम है
