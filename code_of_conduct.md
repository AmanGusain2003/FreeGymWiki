# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in the FreeGym fitness fact-checking community. It applies to all spaces including discussions, wiki pages, and issue trackers.

## Be respectful

Value each other's ideas, styles, and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and perspectives.

## Be collaborative

This is a shared community resource. Work together towards common goals with patience and care. Build on each other's contributions.

## Be truthful

Provide truthful, substantiated, and relevant information to the best of your ability. Promote constructive honest dialogue.

## Be responsible

You are responsible for the content you post and for promoting a helpful, safe, and ethical environment. Cite sources where applicable and test speculative claims before stating them as fact.

## Be charitable

Interpret the arguments of others in good faith. Even if there are misunderstandings, focus on finding common ground and understanding.

## Be caring

Show empathy towards other community members. Do not insult or put down others. Assume the best intentions behind actions.

## Be open

No question is too basic to ask, and no understanding is too simple to gain value from. Stay open-minded in debates and gracefully accept differing views.

## Be bold

Share your perspectives and ask tough questions. We thrive on healthy debates. Do not be afraid to constructively challenge ideas and encourage others to dig deeper.

## Be compassionate

When discussing external creators, criticize claims but not character. Question information but don't belittle messengers who cannot respond. For internal creators, request evidence for claims respectfully.

Violations can be reported to the repository maintainers privately. We hope to build an inclusive space, so please be mindful and practice understanding.
